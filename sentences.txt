## Introduction
- The ubiquity and unprecedented growth of time-varying measurements across scientific and industrial settings are responsible for the increasing popularity of time-series analysis.
- In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.
- To handle these distortions, dozens of distance measures have been proposed in the time-series literature.
- However, implementing a transaction engine on top of a programmable switch does not come "for free" and many challenges need to be addressed.
- There is a recent flurry of research on how to best integrate SIMD into column scans.
- We use the term "point" and "record" interchangeably.

## Theoretical analysis 
- For the sake of convenience, we omit the proof to save the space.

## Reference
- For a comprehensive review of Bloom filters, see Broder and Mitzenmacher.
- We refer to the recent survey [xxx] for further details.

## Experiment
- The diagram unfolds a clear comparison betwee ... and ...
- All experiments were conducted on a machine equipped with an Intel Xeon Gold 5218R CPU @ 2.10GHz (80 cores) with 256GB Memory. All algorithms are implemented in Python with the Numba library.
- Moreover, unless otherwise stated, we use the following system parameters. We set the number of monitors to 60.
- We now demonstrate that, contrary to state of the art predicate evaluation methods, Column Sketches provide an efficient and robust access method regardless of data distribution, data clustering, or selectivity.
- For range queries, the period index performs in par with the interval tree and the 1D-grid.
- Since FG is not open-source, we implement FG from scratch faithfully following the original design principles, as well as caching the top-level nodes on compute nodes for better performance.
- Again, Figure X confirms that our technique is especially effective in XXX for XXX.
- Figure xxx sheds some insight on XXX.
- Our technique can improve xxx for two reasons. First, xxx. Second, xxx. Third, xxx.
